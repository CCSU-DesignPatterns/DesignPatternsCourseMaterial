# CCSU Design Patterns

## Welcome to Design Patterns

[This page will help you get started with git and GitHub](https://github.com/CCSU-DesignPatterns/DesignPatternsCourseInfo/blob/master/Git-ReadMe.md)

We will be covering both in class, but if you run into any challenges you can find resources [on the Git Help page](Help-Git-GitHub.md)

## Course layout
The material for this course is split between Blackboard for course specific information and this GitHub repository which serves as a Open Education Resource (OER) so you don't need to buy any textbooks.
### Blackboard content

* **Announcements** will be posted on the Announcements tab on Blackboard and will go out to your university email account when posted.
* **Assignments** will be posted to the Assignments tab on Blackboard and will submitted via GitHub Classroom as will be explained in the first assignment.
* **Discussion Board** will be used for course discussions and questions on content, assignment, and exam material.
* **Grades** will show your current running numeric grades in the course, but note detailed feedback will be found in GitHub Classroom.
* **Group Sign Up** as group projects come up throughout the semester this will be where you sign up for your group.
