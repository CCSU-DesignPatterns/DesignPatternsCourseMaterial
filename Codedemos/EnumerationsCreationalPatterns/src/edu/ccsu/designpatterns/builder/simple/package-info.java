/**
 * This package contains a implementation
 * of the simplest type of builder pattern.
 * Essentially the builder pattern here is used
 * to allow flexibility in specifying which
 * arguments are needed for constructing the Person
 * object.  This also is simple in that it makes sense
 * for objects creating the person to interact with
 * the builder directly rather than needing a director
 * to construct more complex objects.  In the Main
 * class there is an example of the two different styles
 * of using the builder in this fashion.
